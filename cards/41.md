<!--title={Dynamic Browsing Page Deleting an Event}-->

Use ``router.delete`` to delete specific event IDs. Since we are again looking at one ID, we will need to use ``'/events/:id'``. This method will also be asynchronous and it will use an arrow function.

Within try, we are going to use ``Event.findByIdAndDelete`` and use if/else logic accordingly.
