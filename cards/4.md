<!--title={Dynamic Browsing Page Deleting an Event}-->

Now that we can find new events, we are going to add deleting an event functionality. In the same ``event.js`` file, under the read single event method we are going to add a method that deletes events by accessing the event ID. This method, like the others, will use try and catch. If there is an error, the catch will throw *error 500*. If the event is simply not found, in try, it will throw *error 404*.
