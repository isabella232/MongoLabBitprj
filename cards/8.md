<!--title={Add Events Page}-->

In order for users to GET events, they must first be able to add Events to the website. So let's build the **Add Events** Page. 



Our **Create Events** page is going to look very similar to the **Sign-up** page we built earlier. 



First, make the HTML and CSS files for this page. The page is going to store the following information:

- Event Name
- Event Coordinator
- Date in form of MM/DD/YYYY
- Event Start Time
- Event Location
- Please add a short description
- Number of Attendants at the Event

It should also come with a **Create New Event** button at the end. In case the user wants to cancel the sign-up, we will also add a cancel button that will redirect back to the login page.
