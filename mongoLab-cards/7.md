<!--title={Refactor Static Event Pages to Dynamic}-->

Now it's time to pull it all together on this final step. We have created a database, refactored the Events page to be dynamic, and now it's time to refactor specifc event pages to be dynamic as well. We will be using the same Events database for the information and will be using Handlbars as well.
