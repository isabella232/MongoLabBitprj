 <!--title={Querying Events}-->

Since we've got functionality for getting an Event, let's make it so that you can search for an event by name. Change the **REST API** for the `/events` GET method so that the url can take in an event name of the following format:

```
'/events?eventName=Title'
```

If the URL has an eventName of the above format, it should query for all documents that match the name. Or, if the `/events` method has no edits to the URL is should query all documents as before.
