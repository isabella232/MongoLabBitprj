<!--title={"Add Event" Functionality}-->

After creating the "Add Event" page, we can now add the functionality to it. We will be using a POST method in order to create and add an event to the database. In the page, there is a `<form>` tag that has the following attributes: `action` and `method`. You are to route the form to a POST event with the same route as in `action`. This way, the POST method will only communicate with that specific route.
